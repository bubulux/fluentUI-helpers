### Implemented

For the implemented features just browse the Storybook.
Not only visual components are there, but also hooks and other utilities showcase through wrappers.

### Planned

#### Components

- Atoms: Pagination
- Layout: Grid (not sure, might cause more problems than it solves)
- Animations: FadeIn, FadeOut

#### Hooks

_nothing planned_

#### Theme

- More materials / Morphism for web: Window 11 brings lots of glass / acrylic effects from the [fluent UI language](https://fluent2.microsoft.design/material), there should also be a way to access these in web apps.

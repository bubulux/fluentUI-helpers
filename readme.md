**Disclaimer:** _I am not affiliated in any way with microsoft or fluentui, this is **NOT** a official repository from the fluentui ecosystem_.

### Who is this for?

This library aims at folks that work with microsofts fluentui library, but thinks it lacks some features here and there.

### What does it contain?

It contains helpful hooks / components / theme utils that I was maintaining across different projects, so I decided to make this central repository to share these utils inbetween.

These utils can be common layout utils (like `Flex`, `Grid` etc.), generic and library specific hooks, extended theme tokens, common animations and also full fledged components that are not yet available in fluentui itself (like `Pagination` f.i.).

### Where can I find the docs?

The library docs reside at a dedicated [Storybook](https://bubulux.github.io/fluentui-helpers). You will also find there planned updates / preview components.

### How to contribute or report bugs?

If there any Bugs please open an Issue on GitHub.

If you want to contribute (that is not a bug fix) or suggest a change open a discussion thread :)

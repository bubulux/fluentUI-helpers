**Disclaimer:** _I am not affiliated in any way with Microsoft or Fluent UI. This is **NOT** an official repository from the Fluent UI ecosystem_.

### Who is this for?

This library is aimed at folks who work with Microsoft's Fluent UI library but think it lacks some features here and there.

### What does it contain?

It contains helpful hooks, components, and theme utilities that I was maintaining across different projects. I decided to create this central repository to share these utilities.

These utilities can be common layout utilities (like `Flex`, `Grid`, etc.), generic and library-specific hooks, extended theme tokens, common animations, and also full-fledged components that are not yet available in Fluent UI itself (like `Pagination`, for instance).

### Where can I find the docs?

The library documentation resides at a dedicated [Storybook](https://bubulux.github.io/fluentui-helpers). You will also find planned updates and preview components there.

### How long will I be committed to this?

I am maintaining two larger projects with Fluent UI, one private and one for my company, so there are long-lasting factors that will bind me to this for a while.

### How to contribute or report bugs?

If there are any bugs, please open an issue on GitHub.

If you want to contribute (other than a bug fix) or suggest a change, open a discussion thread :)
